1. Every single day (Day 1 through Day 30) MUST have a completely UNIQUE title, hook line, copywriting caption, call-to-action (CTA), and visual graphic prompt.
2. DO NOT repeat the raw user directive text in every card title or caption! Translate the directive into a real 4-week marketing roadmap:
   - Week 1 (Days 1–7): Awareness & Teasers (Mystery reveal, founder vision, unboxing, key feature teaser).
   - Week 2 (Days 8–14): Value & Deep Dives (Tech specs, problem-solution, myth-busting, stress test, lifestyle styling).
   - Week 3 (Days 15–21): Social Proof & Community (Reviews, case studies, Q&A, behind the scenes, giveaway challenge).
   - Week 4 (Days 22–30): Conversion & Urgency (Launch discount, limited bundle offer, executive pitch, low stock alert, celebration).
3. Output MUST be valid JSON: an array of exactly 30 post objects.
